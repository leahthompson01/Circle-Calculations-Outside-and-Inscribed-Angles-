        <h2>Inscribed Angles</h2>
        <p>An inscribed angle, is an angle inside a circle and is formed when 
            two chords intersect on the circle.
            The relationship is that an inscribed angle is equal to half the length
            of the arc (outside part of the circle) that is directly across from the angle
        </p>

        <h2>Angles Outside of a Circle</h2>
        <p>Outisde angles are formed by the intersection of two chords, which is located outside of the circle.
            The relationship here is that the outside angle is equal to half of the difference of the inner and outer arcs of the circle that 
        lie between the two chords </p>
